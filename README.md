About the React Project
-This is a web application to add, modify, and search for customer accounts, products, and manage orders
-In order to use the app, you must use an IDE like VSC, Pycharm, etc.
-The password has been removed so you must use your own password from MYSQL Connect

Lasly, since the folder was large, the React project is in a zip folder. 

Enjoy!
